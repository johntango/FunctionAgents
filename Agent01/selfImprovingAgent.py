"""
Self-Improving Agent Demo using a Hypothetical OpenAI Agent API with Factory Functions

This script demonstrates an agent that writes and executes new code to enhance its own functionality,
implemented without using classes but instead using a factory function with closures.
Initially, the agent defines a basic power function (squaring the input). Through iterative self-improvement,
the agent generates new code that increases the exponent—illustrating a simple form of self-modification.
This demo environment is intended to impress by showing how an agent’s capabilities can evolve dynamically.
